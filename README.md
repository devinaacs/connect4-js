## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

Want to modify the game? Here are some easy tweaks:

- **Board size**: Change `ROWS` and `COLS` constants
- **Confetti settings**: Tweak particle count and colors in `confetti.js`

## ðŸ¤– AI Strategy

The computer opponent uses a smart strategy:
1. **Win** if it can make 4 in a row
2. **Block** you from winning
3. **Play strategically** by preferring center columns
4. **Random fallback** when no clear move exists

It's challenging but beatable - good luck!
